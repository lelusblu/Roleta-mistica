The previous AI engineer successfully developed a full-stack mystical roulette application from scratch. Initially, a React frontend with mock data was built, followed by comprehensive feature enhancements for conversion optimization, including a multi-step process, lead capture, urgency elements, and a dramatic revelation sequence. Several React DOM  errors were persistently debugged and resolved through iterative refactoring of the  component. Full mobile responsiveness was implemented. Subsequently, a FastAPI backend with MongoDB persistence for leads and readings was integrated and thoroughly tested. Finally, a Facebook Pixel was installed for analytics, and the entire frontend was translated to Spanish. The current ongoing task involves assisting the user with deployment, specifically troubleshooting a build failure on Netlify for a static hosting setup, following the user's attempt to deploy to GitHub Pages and Atomicat. The engineer is currently diagnosing the Netlify build configuration based on the user's GitHub repository structure.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a mystical roulette game app with tarot/oracle cards and mystical message interpretation. Key features included a spinning roulette, user question input, and display of selected card interpretation.
Later, explicit requirements evolved to include:
1.  A promotional call-to-action (CTA) link to an e-book (Códice de la Abundancia) after interpretation.
2.  Limiting users to one reading, with a mechanism to block multiple attempts.
3.  Adding name and email input fields before the question.
4.  Implementing a multi-step process: (1) Name/Email/Question, (2) Roulette/Interpretation, (3) Promotional Page.
5.  Adding urgency elements like a 15-minute countdown timer and Últimas vagas.
6.  Requiring email validation and a progress bar.
7.  Enhancing the card revelation with dramatic animations.
8.  Making the application fully responsive for mobile use.
9.  Removing the reading history from the frontend.
10. Making the revelation step require a user click to proceed to the promotional page, not automatic transition.
11. Implementing a full backend with FastAPI and MongoDB to persist leads and readings.
12. Integrating Facebook Pixel (ID: 1809767262937950) for analytics.
13. Translating the entire frontend user interface to global Spanish.
14. Assistance with deploying the full-stack application to a hosting provider, initially attempting static hosting (Atomicat/GitHub Pages) and then moving towards full-stack hosting (Hostinger).

**Key Files and Changes:**

*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: The main entry point for the React application, handling routing and orchestrating the multi-step user flow.
    *   **Changes**: Initially served a simple Hello World from backend. Now manages the  state to control the multi-stage user journey (form, roulette, interpretation, promotion). Integrated , , , and  components. Also updated for responsiveness and full Spanish translation.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: Provides mock data for tarot cards and interpretations during frontend-only development.
    *   **Changes**: Contains a  array with names, images, and mock mystical interpretations. This was crucial for the initial aha moment without a backend.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: A new component introduced for the first step of the conversion funnel, capturing user's name, email, and question.
    *   **Changes**: Implements form inputs, client-side email validation, and local storage () to prevent multiple attempts. Translated to Spanish.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: The core interactive component, simulating a spinning roulette wheel to select a tarot card.
    *   **Changes**: Heavily refactored multiple times due to recurring React DOM errors (). The final version uses a simplified DOM structure with fixed card representations and pure CSS animations to avoid state conflicts during high-frequency updates, ensuring stability. Also updated for responsiveness and Spanish translation.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: Displays the selected tarot card and its interpretation, along with the user's original question.
    *   **Changes**: Refactored to include dramatic entrance animations, personalized content (displaying user's name and question), positive/challenge sections for the interpretation, and a prominent, click-activated CTA to proceed to the promotional page. Fully translated to Spanish.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: The final stage of the funnel, presenting the e-book promotion and the call-to-action button.
    *   **Changes**: Updated to include a countdown timer (), urgency messages (Últimas X vagas), mock testimonials, and detailed features of the e-book. The main CTA button () was configured to correctly redirect to , handling popup and fallback mechanisms. Translated to Spanish.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: A new component providing visual feedback on the user's progress through the 3-step funnel.
    *   **Changes**: Dynamically updates the progress bar based on the  state. Translated to Spanish.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: The main HTML file for the React application.
    *   **Changes**: Facebook Pixel code was inserted here for global page view tracking and initial event configurations.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: The main FastAPI application, responsible for defining and serving API endpoints.

<current_work>
The immediate work revolves around assisting the user with their deployment efforts. The user successfully uploaded the application code to GitHub and attempted to deploy it to Netlify. However, the deployment failed during the build process, specifically with the command .

The AI engineer has previously provided detailed instructions for static hosting on Netlify, including specific , , and  configurations. The user confirmed that Opção B (Base directory: empty, Build command: , Publish directory: ) worked for the configuration fields.

Upon attempting the deploy, a failed status was reported. The AI engineer's current action is to diagnose this build failure. To do so, the AI has requested the exact file and folder structure visible at the root of the user's GitHub repository (). This information is crucial to confirm if the  directory exists at the expected path, which would validate the  part of the build command. Without this confirmation, the build command might be attempting to change to a directory that doesn't exist at the repository's root, causing the failure.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Receive the GitHub repository's file/folder structure from the user to determine the correct Netlify build configuration and resolve the deployment failure.
